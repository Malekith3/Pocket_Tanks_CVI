As part of our final assignment in the system programming course, we developed a Tanks game, reminiscent of the well-known game "The Worms." The project was implemented in the CVI environment using the C programming language.

## Object-Oriented Approach
To add an extra layer of challenge, we opted for an object-oriented style of programming, a departure from C's non-object-oriented nature. This decision provided valuable insights into the inner workings of object-oriented programming (OO), enhanced code readability, reusability, and facilitated our continuous learning.
